## Demo challenge

In this lesson, we will get acquainted with the layout of Katacoda.

You can execute snippets of code directly from the panel here.

Once in the appropriate folder, we can execute a script below. Feel free to explore the content in the folder as well.

```bash
cd sandbox/01-Demo-challenge
```{{execute}}


```python
python3 hello.py
```{{execute}}
