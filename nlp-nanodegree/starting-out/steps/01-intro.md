## Introduction

Welcome to our pilot course for Natural Language Processing. At inclusive-ml are so glad to welcome you and look forward to this journey we will take together.

<!-- You can get code to execute -->


## Why this tokenize function?

We carefully selected our pilot students based on previous engagement with data science.

The `demo.py` file is simply to orient you, and to demonstrate how we are linking to GitHub. Don't worry, we will get there next ;)

Later, we will have tests for your code but for now simply run the `demo.py` file from the commandline. Don't forget to use python3!

## Pushing to Git

Once you've had a read and a play, let's push to GitHub ðŸ˜Š

```bash
git add demo.py
git commit -m "Alright, first challenge was easy, give me more!"
git push origin main
```

Thanks to the [magic of GitHub webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) we learn about your push, run some tests, and update your challenges with your progress.

Let's get started!

<!--
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

Or to be simply copied in the clipboard

````python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Le InclusiveML location
    lat1, lon1 = 48.865070, 2.380009
    #Insert your coordinates from google maps here
    #lat2, lon2 = x, y
    distance = haversine(lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2)
    print(distance)
