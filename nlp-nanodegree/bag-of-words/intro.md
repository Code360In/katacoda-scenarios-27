# What is a bag of words algorithm, or BOW?

A method which extracts the essential features from raw text so that we can use it for machine learning models. 

“Bag” of words refers to the fact that we don't care about the order of words, only the frequency of which the words in the text occur. By measuring the frequency of the most used words in a text (not including very frequent or very infrequent words) we can get an idea of the relevant topics of a given text.
