It is a method of extracting essential features from row text so that we can use it for machine learning models. We call it “Bag” of words because we discard the order of occurrences of words. A bag of words model converts the raw text into words, and it also counts the frequency for the words in the text. In summary, a bag of words is a collection of words that represent a sentence along with the word count where the order of occurrences is not relevant.
